The tumor is located on the T-L spine, an anaplastic astrocytoma that cannot be removed by radiation. It's complicated by progressive lower-extremity weakness and urinary retention. The patient initially presented with RLE, which is difficulty walking in the right knee and numbness in the right frontal lobe. MRI showed a spinal cord cone mass that was biopsied and found to be an anaplastic astrocytoma. Treatment included t10-l1 area radiation followed by 11 rounds of temozolomide for 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by Avastin Q2 weeks/2 weeks, with a CPT-11 x4 rest and repeat cycle per week.</topic><topic number="2">In the story HT, a 48-year-old smoker with hyperlipidemia and bicuspid aortic stenosis, went to the cardiologist with complaints of progressive respiratory distress and lower extremity edema on [**2148-10-1**] date. TTE was found to be severe aortic stenosis and worsened LV function. His right ventricular pressure was 41 and he had a biatrial dilation. He was diagnosed with mild MR (mitral regurgitation) and second-degree aortic insufficiency. He was sent home from the cardiology clinic with Lasix and BB{\beta blocker} (couldn't tolerate it), SOB{\shortness of breath} and LE{\lower extremity} (feed) continued to deteriorate and was finally brought here for evaluation. Repeated echocardiography during this stay confirmed left ventricular hypertrophy, cavitation dilation and severe global hypokinesia, severe aortic stenosis with the bicuspid aortic valve underlying, dilated aortic outlet and critical aortic stenosis showing mild pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension. The patient was given a preoperative CT scan of the chest for preoperative cap replacement and a preoperative examination with carotid US (medium heterogeneous plaque and bilateral 1-39% ICA ((Internal Carotid Arter) narrowing). Cardiac catheterization was also performed in combination with right-heart catheterization to assess pulmonary artery pressures, and angiographically no flow-limiting coronary artery disease was detected.</topic><topic number="3">A 32-year-old woman came in complaining of a severe "exploding" headache. He and his wife reported that he was in the kitchen yesterday when he got up and hit his head on the corner of a cabinet. The next morning, I suddenly had a "blasting" headache. When he arrived at the hospital, his brain CT showed a significant amount of blood in his right ventricle. The NSGY assessed the patient for spontaneous intraventricular bleeding with concern for an underlying vascular malformation. Cerebral angiography showed abnormal vascularization with a drainage vein that penetrates deep white matter from the left temporal lobe and is consistent with AVM. The patient's headaches continued, but they were getting better with painkillers. The patient refused physical therapy evaluation, but was able to walk independently without any problems. He was released to his home with his wife on [**2155-12-6**].</topic><topic number="4">A 44-year-old woman with a history of PCOS, obesity and hypertension came in with symptoms of cholecystitis and was accidentally diagnosed with a large pericardial effusion. Pericardiosynthesis was performed, and the fluid analysis was consistent with Burkitt's lymphoma. The pericardial fluid was cappa light chain restricted CD10 positive monotypic B cells, which represented rearrangement of FMC-7, CD19, CD20 and MYC compatible with Burkitt lymphoma. The subsequent lumbar puncture and bone marrow biopsy were negative for any traces, indicating the condition as primary cardiac lymphoma. Cardiac MRI showed a mass of 3 cm x 1 cm in the lateral wall of the right atrium adjacent to the AV junction. Medical history: one. Rare migraine two. High blood pressure 3. Obesity is 4.

She was treated for high white blood cell count and LDH on 10/21. At the time, he didn't have any splenomegaly or cytopenia. He had some major lymphadenopathy. He then completed four FCR cycles in 09/[**2119**]. She responded to the treatment perfectly and was followed for about two years without treatment. He then presented with an elevated white blood cell count at [**7-/2122**], approximately 50% lymphocytes, and mildly elevated LDH. He also had lymphadenopathy, which worsened slightly on manual examination. He then received four rounds of PCR, but could not get much in terms of response, and the treatment regimen was transferred to R-CVP, where he received two rounds. Again, he did not get a significant response, but continued to show excellent performance status and was eventually transferred to Campath treatment. He improved his lymphocytosis and his white blood cell count dropped significantly, but it didn't have much effect on reducing his major lymphadenopathy. Eventually, the left cervical lymph node developed, and a biopsy was done, and it was found to have a Richter transformation.</topic><topic number="9">A 41-year-old male patient with severe mental impairment, history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and epilepsy, was referred to NH (Nursing Home) with numbness and widespread trembling in his right face and received 20 mg of valium to stop seizure activity. The patient receiving outside medical care was thought to have secondary generalized focal epilepsy, probably due to anoxic brain injury at birth and associated with atrophic changes seen on MRI, especially in the left temporal lobe. The patient first had a seizure at age 13 and was diagnosed by her family as having generalized convulsions. Two years after the first attack, he had a second attack. Dilantin and phenobarbital continued. The patient hasn't had another seizure in 20 years. Recently, Dilantin was reduced and it was thought that it might be necessary to keep him out of seizures. The patient had no other events during the hospital stay and was back to baseline when discharged. Full EEG reports are expected during dictation.

The patient was agitated at first, then fell asleep. His daughter has reported increased agitation and altered mental status for the past two or three days while her O2 saturation was in the 60s and 70s. Her daughter also noticed that she had increased lower respiratory tract edema and weight gain, which caused her to call her GP and increase the dose of lasix from 80 mg daily to 100 mg daily, resulting in a slight improvement in edema. At home, he experienced a decrease in appetite, PO intake, and energy levels, and he experienced difficulty in daily activities. Except for chronic right hip pain that's been going on for the last 1-2 months, he has no fever, cough, tremor, excretion of sputum, cerebral palsy (CP), abdominal pain, or any other complaint.

For several weeks before he was hospitalized, he had a pain in his midsection that spread to his left kidney. It's been going on all day, it doesn't increase with food, but it does with vomiting and it gets worse with coughing. Later on [**4-20**] a CT of the uncontrasted abdomen was taken and a large, heterogeneous mass measuring 9.5 x 7.5 x 6.0 cm was seen in the upper left abdomen. The patient was given an EUS (Endoscopic Usg) with a biopsy. The biopsy results were consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma at the beginning of the pancreas. A splenic curvature/pancreatic tail mass was also seen in BT; given the patient's recent history of diverticulitis, it was likely diverticular apse; this was thought to be fluid buildup or abscess in the infection. The patient was administered IV antibiotics (Zosyn, followed by ceftriaxone and flagyl) and will continue these treatments until seen by ID (Infection Patients) as a standing patient.
